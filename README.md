This repository gives us a glimpse of what the client side (website) looks like.
This is done using reactjs, nodejs (expressjs), and MongoDB as its database.
Also, using cool CSS tools, we can see the website has a minimalist UI design.
This meeting website can be helpful in real-life company work.
Starting with Login, Signup, Dashboard, and Profile Page, this is how the website is split.
